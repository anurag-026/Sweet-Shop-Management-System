# Analytics Implementation Summary

## Overview
We've implemented a comprehensive analytics system for the Sweet Shop application to provide detailed insights into sales, customers, inventory, and website performance. This system replaces the mock data with real-time analytics based on actual application data.

## Database Schema Enhancements

### New Tables
1. **Supplier** - Tracks supplier information for inventory management
2. **ProductAnalytics** - Tracks product performance metrics (sales, views, revenue)
3. **CustomerSegment** - Defines customer segments for targeted marketing
4. **CustomerAnalytics** - Tracks customer behavior and purchase patterns
5. **WebsiteTraffic** - Tracks website visits and user behavior
6. **ConversionEvent** - Tracks user journey through the conversion funnel
7. **InventoryHistory** - Tracks inventory changes for audit and analysis
8. **ShippingAnalytics** - Tracks shipping performance metrics
9. **OrderAnalytics** - Tracks detailed order metrics for business intelligence
10. **MonthlySales** - Aggregates sales data by month for trend analysis
11. **CategorySales** - Tracks sales performance by product category
12. **SystemAlert** - Stores system alerts for monitoring and notifications

### Enhanced Existing Tables
1. **Sweet** - Added cost, profit margin, supplier reference, and inventory thresholds
2. **Order** - Already enhanced with payment mode and tracking fields

## Entity Models
Created Java entity models for all new tables with appropriate relationships:
- One-to-many relationships between Supplier and Sweet
- One-to-many relationships between CustomerSegment and CustomerAnalytics
- One-to-one relationships between Order and OrderAnalytics/ShippingAnalytics
- Many-to-one relationships for product and category analytics

## Repository Layer
Implemented JPA repositories for all new entities with specialized query methods:
- Aggregation queries for sales and revenue metrics
- Time-based queries for period analysis
- Filtering queries for segmentation and categorization

## Service Layer
1. **AnalyticsService** - Provides data for the admin dashboard
   - Retrieves and formats analytics data for frontend consumption
   - Handles time range filtering for different analytics views
   - Provides fallback to calculated data when aggregated data is unavailable

2. **AnalyticsCollectionService** - Collects and processes analytics data
   - Tracks product views, cart additions, and purchases
   - Updates product and category analytics on order creation
   - Segments customers based on purchase behavior
   - Generates alerts for low stock and other system events
   - Runs scheduled tasks for data aggregation

3. **AnalyticsIntegrationService** - Integrates analytics into application workflow
   - Provides methods for controllers to track user actions
   - Captures HTTP request data for session tracking
   - Bridges between application events and analytics collection

## API Layer
Updated the AdminAnalyticsController and AdminOrdersController to use real data instead of mock data:

### Analytics APIs (All returning real data from database)

- **GET** `/api/admin/orders?status=PENDING&page=0&size=20&sort=createdAt,desc` - List all orders with filtering and pagination
- **GET** `/api/admin/orders/recent?limit=20` - Recent orders list

#### Order Status Management
- **PUT** `/api/admin/orders/{orderId}/status` - Update order status
  - Request Body: `{"status": "SHIPPED"}`
  - Valid statuses: PENDING, CONFIRMED, PROCESSING, SHIPPED, OUT_FOR_DELIVERY, DELIVERED, CANCELLED, REFUNDED
  - Automatically sets delivery dates based on status changes

## Data Collection Points
Identified key points in the application workflow for data collection:
1. Product page views
2. Add to cart actions
3. Checkout initiation
4. Order completion
5. Inventory updates
6. Website visits and session tracking

## Integration Strategy
The analytics system is designed to work alongside the existing application with minimal changes to core functionality:
- Non-intrusive data collection via service calls
- Asynchronous processing where possible to minimize performance impact
- Fallback mechanisms when analytics data is not yet available
- Scheduled aggregation to maintain performance with growing data

## Recent Fixes and Improvements

### Mock Data Elimination
All analytics APIs have been updated to return real data from the database instead of mock/sample data:

1. **Customer Segments** - Now calculates real customer segments based on actual order frequency and value
2. **Alerts** - Generates dynamic alerts based on real-time data:
   - Low stock alerts (products with quantity 1-10)
   - Out of stock alerts (products with quantity 0)
   - New orders alerts (orders in the last hour)
   - High-value orders alerts (orders >$500 today)
3. **Order Management** - All order APIs now return real order data with proper filtering and pagination
4. **Inventory Analytics** - Real inventory status based on actual product quantities

### Frontend Integration Fixes

1. **AdminDashboard.jsx** - Completely refactored to use real API responses instead of mock data
   - Removed dependency on `adminAnalytics` mock data
   - Added proper loading states and error handling
   - All analytics now fetch from actual backend APIs
